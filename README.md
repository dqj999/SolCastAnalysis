# SolCastAnalysis
This Excel Spreadsheet analyses the SolisManagerExecutionHistory.csv file which contains Solcast data

It calculates the ratio  between Forecast and Actual Solar data for each half hour.

One method compares the averages of the above, while the other
compares the maximums of the Forecast and the actual solar data.

It turns out that using the maximum values gives more stable values because
using the maximum values corresponds to full sunshine conditions, so the 
effects of weather are minmised.
